## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This is an app where a user can browse yoga poses to build their own routine. The user will use built-in audio cues and be able to manipulate the time stamp for each pose. The user can then play the routine back for their workout. The app will include information, photos, and instructions for each pose.


### Features
Pose Directory: Users will be able to view/choose from a library of yoga poses that they would like to add to their routine.

Pose Info/Modal: This feature will provide the user with information about the pose. In this modal you can choose to add the selected pose to your routine or alternatively close out the modal if you decide you do not want to choose it.

Routine Buidler: The user will be utlizing this feature to build their routine. This will allow the user to edit (add/delete) & re-arrange yoga poses to assemble a custom routine. 

Routine Player: Once the user has build a routine, this will be the feature that runs through the routine. The user will be able to play, pause, stop & exit the playback of the custom routine.
